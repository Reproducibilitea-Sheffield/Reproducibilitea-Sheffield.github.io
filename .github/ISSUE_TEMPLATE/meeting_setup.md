It is important to book a room with AV equipment as the intention is to hold hybrid events and so a decent AV equipment
is essential. This requires the ability to connect the leads laptop to the display equipment via HDMI and a camera for
sharing the room view.

It is important that a calendar event is created and that a Google Meet link is included. Once created HTML for sharing
the calendar event can be copy and pasted into the web-page that is created for the site and included in the mailing lists.

## Web Page

[Quarto](https://quarto.org). The [front-page of this
