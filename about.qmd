Welcome to the Reproducibilitea Sheffield Blog. This site details up-coming journal clubs and summaries of the
discussions held at previous Journal Clubs. We aim to hold one Journal Club roughly every month where a topical paper on
Open Research will be discussed, it would be great if people are able to read the paper before hand and note down what
they liked and disliked about it and topics for discussion, but if you haven't time don't worry, a brief summary will be
given at the start.

To find out about up-coming events you can [join the mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/reproducibilitea) or use the [RSS
feed](https://reproducibilitea-sheffield.github.io/index.xml). If you have any questions please [get in
touch](mailto:reproducibilitea@sheffield.ac.uk).

To find out more about these journal clubs please visit the [ReproducibiliTea - Journal Clubs for Open
Science](https://reproducibilitea.org/) website.
