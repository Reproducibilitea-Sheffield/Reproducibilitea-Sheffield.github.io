## What

The chosen articles that we will review and discuss are from _Educational Research and Evaluation_

+ Replication is relevant to qualitative research (2022). [doi :
  10.1080/13803611.2021.2022310](https://doi.org/10.1080/13803611.2021.2022310)

> Replication has received increasing attention over the last decade. This comes on the heels of prominent instances of
> data fabrication (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2017) and estimates that few studies
> attempt to replicate previous findings (Makel & Plucker, 2014). Replication has been called the Supreme Court of science
> (Collins, 1985), as well as a basic building block of scholarship. One persistent question in informal conversations
> that we have not seen addressed in formal writing, is replication’s relevance to qualitative research. Qualitative
> research is "a situated activity that locates the observer in the world" and "consists of a set of interpretive,
> material practices that make the world visible" (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011, p. 3). Some have argued that replication
> “missed the point” of qualitative research (Pratt et al., 2020, p. 3). However, in a survey of nearly 1,500 recently
> published education researchers, less than 10% of qualitative researchers reported that replication should never be used
> (Makel et al., 2021). Given the prevalence of qualitative research in education, it is important to examine
> replication’s relevance. In this commentary, we argue that replication is relevant to the qualitative lens in at least
> three ways. First, replication supports the established values in qualitative research of transparency and
> intentionality. Second, replication can be used to assess the well-established tradition of transferability. Third,
> replication can evaluate connections between reflexivity, as evidenced by positionality statements, and qualitative
> research findings.

...and an article in response...

+ Is replication _possible_ in qualitative research? A response to Makel et al. [doi:
  10.1080/13803611.2024.2314526](https://doi.org/10.1080/13803611.2024.2314526)

> There has been much debate in recent years about how open research practices, which have been promoted in efforts to
> improve research robustness, may (not) be appropriate for qualitative methodologies, particularly in educational
> research. Among these is a concern for replication efforts. Makel et al. (Citation2022) make the case that
> “replication is relevant to qualitative research”. The authors argue that concerns surrounding the transferability,
> intentionality, and transparency of qualitative research may be eased, or responded to, by replication studies. Here,
> I argue that there are three fundamental questions that need unpacking before declarative claims can be made about the
> relevance of replication to qualitative research. This includes critical questioning of what we mean by: replication,
> qualitative research, and rigour. I address each of these issues and encourage a more nuanced appraisal of how
> replication may, or may not, be epistemologically, ontologically, or methodologically compatible with the goals of
> qualitative research.
