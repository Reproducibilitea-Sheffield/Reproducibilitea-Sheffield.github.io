## What

The chosen article to that we will review and discuss is an essay from _The Journal of Electronic Publishing_

+ Pooley J. Surveillance Publishing _The Journal of Electronic Publishing_ (2022). [doi :
  10.3998/jep.1874](https://doi.org/10.3998/jep.1874)

> This essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing, with special attention to the example of Elsevier. A
> scholarly publisher can be defined as a surveillance publisher if it derives a substantial proportion of its revenue
> from prediction products, fueled by data extracted from researcher behavior. The essay begins by tracing the Google
> search engine’s roots in bibliometrics, alongside a history of the citation analysis company that became, in 2016,
> Clarivate. The essay develops the idea of surveillance publishing by engaging with the work of Shoshana Zuboff, Jathan
> Sadowski, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar, and Aziz Huq. The recent history of Elsevier is traced to describe the company’s
> research-lifecycle data-harvesting strategy, with the aim to develop and sell prediction products to unviersity and
> other customers. The essay concludes by considering some of the potential costs of surveillance publishing, as other
> big commercial publishers increasingly enter the predictive-analytics business. It is likely, I argue, that windfall
> subscription-and-APC profits in Elsevier’s “legacy” publishing business have financed its decade-long acquisition
> binge in analytics. The products’ purpose, moreover, is to streamline the top-down assessment and evaluation practices
> that have taken hold in recent decades. A final concern is that scholars will internalize an analytics mindset, one
> already encouraged by citation counts and impact factors.

Adam Partridge (Open Research Training Lead / ELIXIR-UK DaSH Fellow at University of Sheffield) will give a brief
summary of the article and will open discussion by highlighting some of the points he thought were good/bad about the
paper.
