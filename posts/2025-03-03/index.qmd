## What

The chosen article that we will review and discuss is...

- [The replication crisis has led to positive structural, procedural, and community changes | Communications Psychology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00003-2)

> The emergence of large-scale replication projects yielding successful rates substantially lower than expected caused
> the behavioural, cognitive, and social sciences to experience a so-called ‘replication crisis’. In this Perspective,
> we reframe this ‘crisis’ through the lens of a credibility revolution, focusing on positive structural, procedural and
> community-driven changes. Second, we outline a path to expand ongoing advances and improvements. The credibility
> revolution has been an impetus to several substantive changes which will have a positive, long-term impact on our
> research environment.
