## What

The chosen articles that we will review and discuss is from _Educational Research and Evaluation_

+ Accelerating the open research agenda to solve global challenges (2024). [doi
  :10.1002/ece3.10887](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10887)

> Harnessing science-based policy is key to addressing global challenges like the biodiversity and climate crises. Open
> research principles underpin effective science-based policy, but the uptake of these principles is likely constrained
> by the politicisation, commoditisation and conflicting motives of stakeholders in the research landscape. Here, using
> the mission and vision statements from 129 stakeholders from across the research landscape, we explore alignment in
> open research principles between stakeholders. We find poor alignment between stakeholders, largely focussed around
> journals, societies and funders, all of which have low open research language-use. We argue that this poor alignment
> stifles knowledge flow within the research landscape, ultimately limiting the mobilisation of impactful science-based
> policy. We offer recommendations on how the research landscape could embrace open research principles to accelerate
> societies' ability to solve global challenges.

Zuzanna Zagrodzka (PhD Student, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) will take us through her recently published paper
looking at the alignment of open research policy in stakeholders, its impact and recommendations on improving the situation.
