## What

The chosen article that we will review and discuss is from _F1000 Research_

+ Ten considerations for open peer review
  (2018). [doi:10.12688/f1000research.15334.1](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.15334.1)


> Open peer review (OPR), as with other elements of open science and open research, is on the rise. It aims to bring
> greater transparency and participation to formal and informal peer review processes. But what is meant by `open peer
> review', and what advantages and disadvantages does it have over standard forms of review? How do authors or reviewers
> approach OPR? And what pitfalls and opportunities should you look out for? Here, we propose ten considerations for OPR,
> drawing on discussions with authors, reviewers, editors, publishers and librarians, and provide a pragmatic, hands-on
> introduction to these issues. We cover basic principles and summarise best practices, indicating how to use OPR to
> achieve best value and mutual benefits for all stakeholders and the wider research community.
