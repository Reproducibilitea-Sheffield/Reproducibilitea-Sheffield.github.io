## What

The chosen article to that we review and discuss is a recent publication _Nature Human Behaviour_

+ Protzko, J., Krosnick, J., Nelson, L. et al. High replicability of newly discovered social-behavioural findings is
  achievable. Nat Hum Behav (2023). [doi : 10.1038/s41562-023-01749-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01749-9)

> Failures to replicate evidence of new discoveries have forced scientists to ask whether this unreliability is due to
> suboptimal implementation of methods or whether presumptively optimal methods are not, in fact, optimal. This paper
> reports an investigation by four coordinated laboratories of the prospective replicability of 16 novel experimental
> findings using rigour-enhancing practices: confirmatory tests, large sample sizes, preregistration and methodological
> transparency. In contrast to past systematic replication efforts that reported replication rates averaging 50%,
> replication attempts here produced the expected effects with significance testing (P < 0.05) in 86% of attempts,
> slightly exceeding the maximum expected replicability based on observed effect sizes and sample sizes. When one lab
> attempted to replicate an effect discovered by another lab, the effect size in the replications was 97% that in the
> original study. This high replication rate justifies confidence in rigour-enhancing methods to increase the
> replicability of new discoveries.

Neil Shephard (Research Software Engineer at University of Sheffield) will give a brief summary of the article and will
open discussion by highlighting some of the points he thought were good/bad about the paper.
