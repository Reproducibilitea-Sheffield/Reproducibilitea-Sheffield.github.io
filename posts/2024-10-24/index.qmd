## What

The chosen article that we will review and discuss is from the [_Annual Review of Applied
Linguistics_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annual-review-of-applied-linguistics).

+ _Promises and perils of positionality statements_
  (2024). [DOI:10.1017/S0267190524000035](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0267190524000035)

> Positionality statements have increasingly become the norm in many strands of social science research, including
> applied linguistics. With reference to current research, theory, and the authorâ€™s own work, this paper reviews some of
> the promises and perils of such statements, including their performativity and lack of reflexivity. The author
> concludes by arguing that positionality statements need to offer both more and less, to be better targeted, and be
> more effectively and widely utilized within the field of applied linguistics.

Dr Jenni Adams (Open Research Manager) will take us through this paper highlighting some salient points and opening
discussion.
